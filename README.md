## Project Title:

Sentiment Analysis on Danamon Bank Apps

## Project Description
This study focuses on leveraging machine learning to automate sentiment analysis of user reviews for the "Danamon Mobile Banking" application. By training various models like NB, LR, KNN, SVM, RF, DT, AdaBoost, and XGB on a dataset of user reviews, we aim to identify the most accurate model for sentiment classification. The outcome will provide the bank with a tool that can quickly and accurately gauge user sentiment, allowing for more informed decisions regarding app development and user experience improvements.

## Conclusion
From the analysis and modeling above, we can conclude that there are a lot of insights that we can take and apply to our main business, especially banking applications.

However. From the trained model, namely hard voting as an ensemble model, we can see that.

Accuracy on training data (Training Accuracy) is around 92.67%.
The accuracy of the test data (Test Accuracy) is around 85.73%.
There is a difference between training accuracy and test accuracy, but the difference is not too big. Although the model appears to be slightly overfit (as performance on training data is better than on test data), the difference between the two accuracies is still within reasonable limits for many practical applications.

In the context of sentiment analysis, 85.73% accuracy on test data is a fairly good result. Of course, there is always room for improvement, but if you need a quick solution or if you are working with limited data or resources, this model can be considered adequate to use.
